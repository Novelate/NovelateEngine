* Novelate is a free and open-source visual novel engine and framework written in the D programming language.
* It can be used freely for both personal and commercial projects.
* ------
* Module Description:
* This module handles the global state of the visual novel. Global states are only available internal in the engine and are used to share data between parts that aren\t interacting with each other.
* At some point these states needs to be rewritten so they're used more safely but as of now they function and doesn't require a lot to maintain.
